CMake Warning (dev) at C:/Program Files/JetBrains/CLion 2022.2.3/bin/cmake/win/share/cmake-3.23/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (OpenCV)
  does not match the name of the calling package (OpenCv).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  C:/opencv/build/OpenCVConfig.cmake:354 (find_package_handle_standard_args)
  CMakeLists.txt:5 (find_package)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
